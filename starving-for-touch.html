It determines our happiness as adults. These good relationships protect our bodies, not just our brains.</p><p><strong>But what does it mean to spend quality time with children?</strong></p><p>The first time I thought of it was when I understood that parents were changing the nappies of kids while showing mobile. Because that makes the nappy-changing process easier and less messy. <em>Fatafat kaam ho jaata hai.</em> But what goes missing is the locking of our eyes with the kids, the kid smiling and us smiling back, cooing making pleasant noises and talking to the kid.</p><p>All this is love.</p><p>And this love unknowingly is going missing from our relationship with our children.</p><p><strong>Let’s scientifically understand what happens when we look at a child and smile.</strong></p><p>When our eyes lock with the child when we respond to the child&#x27;s needs two neural networks in the brain are stimulated. The first one is attached to the identification of humans through smell, and face recognition and the second neural network is the one which stimulates pleasure. This forms an association between the two patterns. When I see my mother, I feel happy. That is why your child is happy to see your face. This interconnection is the glue that creates healthy relationships.</p><p>When this gets replaced by mobile, this part of the brain stops developing. In this respect our brain is like a muscle - it gets stronger with practice. So, the part of the brain which is not used starts to reduce. The part that shows the child ‘how to love’ stops developing.</p><p>To understand this more, let’s look at an extreme case. </p><p><strong>So what happens when this quality love time goes missing?</strong></p><p>Bruce D. Perry who is the world&#x27;s leading expert in dealing with child trauma shared an example of a girl who at the age of 4 was only 12 kgs of weight. Her mother had tried everything, but it didn’t work. The doctors had tried feeding her through tubes as well, but she was not gaining weight. </p><p>So, they called in Dr Perry to take a look. And when he came, he saw that the food was in front of the child and the mother was watching TV barely looking at her. He then decided to talk to the mother. As he spoke to the mother about her own childhood, he found out that the mother till the age of 5 had not known love. Her parents had left her, and she had been thrown from one foster home to another.</p><p>It was only after the age of 5 she found loving parents who adopted her. And these parents taught her right from wrong. They taught her morals like stealing is not good. That one should go to church. One should be a good person. But because in the first 5 years, she had had extreme deprivation of love her capacity to learn ‘how to love’ was never born. She had not experienced that feeling of pleasure that comes from a parent looking warmly at a child or hugging her.</p><p>When she turned 18 because of the law she had to leave the family and live by herself. She got pregnant. The father of the child did not want to be involved so here she was with a baby and no knowledge of what to do. Only her mind knew she must take care of the baby. So, she did all tasks robotically without showing love. But she couldn&#x27;t understand the calls of the baby. She didn’t know how she was supposed to reply. And the baby stopped gaining weight. </p><p>Most doctors diagnosed this as a gastric issue, but Dr Perry was quick to see that this was not an issue of the stomach but the issue of the child feeling unwanted. So what he did was he got the mother and the child to live with another parent and child, so that the mother could learn parenting. Learn to respond to the cues of the child. And within one month the child gained 5 kgs. Today the child is in college and has a more or less normal life.</p><p>Now, this is an extreme story.</p><p>But the question that came to my mind was that <strong>&#x27;Is it possible that our children of well-meaning well-to-do parents are also starving for touch?&#x27;</strong></p><p>This got stuck in my head because I hear more and more parents talking about their children as being a little anxious. And I started thinking about the daily life of children today. As there are more and more screens, as children sit alone and watch TV, as the nappy is changed while watching mobile, as parents get busy and nanny takes care of the responsibilities, as grandparents don’t live with us anymore - the lives of kids over the last few decades has changed.</p><p><strong>This change is new. This is not in sync with the expectation of the child based on evolution.</strong></p><p>The reason we know this is because of Jean Leidloff. Jean went and lived with tribes in the Venezuelan jungle for 2.5 years. She had gone there for diamond mining but found something more profound. She noticed how there was no dissatisfaction, no unhappiness in these tribes.</p><p>She saw how children were being brought up in these tribes. A child after being born was always with the mother in body-to-body touch. And the mother was active. She was going about her work. She didn’t get a 6-month leave. But the important bit was that wherever she went, she took the child. She went to fill the water; the child was there listening to the sound of water. She wanted to cook food, the child was in her lap resting between the thigh and the stomach. Always body-to-body touch. The child having listened to the heartbeat in the womb continued to enjoy the sound of the heartbeat of his mother. If there was a gathering or a party then the child went with the mother, the mother danced, and the child saw things swirling around. The child saw the sky, and the stars, and felt the wind. He was with his mother, and he had a lot of experiences around him.</p><p>This has completely changed in the last few hundred years. Today a baby after being born is separated from the mother to be cleaned. When the baby is born there is this urge for the mother to nurse the child, and give milk. This urge when not fulfilled is said to be the main cause of postpartum depression and other low feelings in the mother. In old times when a natural urge was stopped, it meant that the child is dead, it is stillborn. That is how the body perceives it. But in today’s modern world, we are artificially creating the same feeling in mothers.</p><p>After birth, the baby is kept wrapped in a cloth and kept separately in a nice-looking cradle. The baby is longing for the touch of his mother but has to do the non-living cloth. It wakes up and finds the mother is not there and starts to cry. We take it as a cry for hunger and feed for a few minutes and keep the baby aside. We are told not to feed the baby when the baby demands but in specific order otherwise <em>aadat pad jayegi.</em> We are told to not let the baby sleep with us. We are told to keep silent so that the baby does not wake up.</p><p>All of this is a recent ‘change’. And this is not the expectation of the newborn baby based on millions of years of evolution.</p><p><strong>Because it is possible that this ‘starving for touch’ is happening silently to millions of children of well-meaning parents across the world.</strong></p><p>If you are in the life stage where you are expecting or have an infant – body-to-body touch is the best thing that you can do for your child. But for many of us, this life stage of the infant kid is passed.</p><p>So the thing to understand is that if the expectation of love is not fulfilled as an infant, it continues. This lack of love can manifest as a child who gets upset easily, who is not comforted easily, who seems normal but anxious underneath the skin, who fails to develop empathy for others because she has not experienced it herself as skin-to-skin love.</p><p>So the question we can still ponder over is that as a nanny picks up the child from the school bus, does the child get a hug or only gets pulled to cross the road? When the nanny gives her food, does she do so automatedly or does she smile and touch the back of the child&#x27;s back and head?</p><p>As a couple, Bhakti and I have done a lot of these mistakes. For my wife Bhakti and I, the takeaway was to hug our daughter more often. To spend time with our child without the screen. To smile more often at her. To ensure she understands through our body and our smile that she is loved. So that she can feel loved, and she can learn how to love.</p></div></div></div><div class="div-block-150"><h1 class="newsletter-heading">The Curious Parent Podcast</h1><h3 class="heading-46">5 min to understand your child better</h3><div class="div-block-152"><div class="w-embed w-iframe"><iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/2xDnbNC16WhrR06eoe7XBi?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div></div><a href="/podcast" class="button podcastpage w-button">View all episodes </a></div><div class="likeepisodeform newsletterblog"><p class="paragraph-15">Join the curious parents&#x27; community to receive one researched newsletter every month to understand your child better. </p><div class="form w-form"><form id="email-form" name="email-form" data-name="Email Form" method="get" class="form-3"><input type="email" class="text-field-2-copy w-input" maxlength="256" name="email-5" data-name="Email 5" placeholder="Your email" id="email-5" required=""/><input type="submit" value="Be a Curious Parent" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button w-button"/></form><div class="success-message-2 w-form-done"><div class="successtext">Thank you for joining the community of curious parents!</div></div><div class="error-message w-form-fail"><div class="errortext">Oops!
